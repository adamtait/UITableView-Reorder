# UITableView+Reorder

This provides easy row reordering with a long press gesture for any UITableView without entering edit mode. It is very easy to use since everything is encapsulated in a category (like [Wenting Liu](https://github.com/wentingliu) did). The difference between this implementation and his is that no modifications are made to the data source until the use stops dragging the row. This is how the built-in reorder functionality works, in fact, an effort was made to make this category work as closely as possible to the built-in functionality.

This did introduce a little additional complexity in its use. This complexity is in three areas:

1. If the tableview has more than one section it is possible that the tableview will have a different number of rows in a section than the data source says are in the section. This occurs when a row has been dragged from one section to another section. To account for this a helper method is provided to correct the count. Calling `- (NSInteger) adjustedValueForReorderingOfRowCount: (NSInteger) rowCount forSection: (NSInteger) section` will result in the correct value being returned all the time.
2. While a row is being dragged up or down the table there is a disconnect between where the data for that row exists in the data source and where that row is on the screen. In order to deal with this another helper method is provided that translates the index path for the visilbe location on the screen to the index path in the data source: `- (NSIndexPath *) dataSourceIndexPathFromVisibleIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath`. This should be used in all tableview delegate or datasource methods that have an `NSIndexPath` argument that is used to get data from the data source.
3. There is an empty place left in the tableview for the row that is being dragged. It is the responsibility of the tableview's data source to provide this cell instead of the normal cell. A helper method is provided so `- (UITableViewCell *) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath` knows whether to return the real cell or the place holder called `- (BOOL) shouldSubstitutePlaceHolderForCellBeingMovedAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath`.

Everything else that is done is identical to the configuration needed for having row reordering through the built-in methodology. This includes:

1. Implement:

````
- (void) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView moveRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) fromIndexPath toIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) toIndexPath;
````

2. Moveable rows must be moveable so if

````
- (BOOL) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView canMoveRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath;
````

is implemented then it must return **YES** for any rows that you want to be able to move.

3. Moveable rows must be editable so if

````
- (BOOL) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView canEditRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath;
````

is implemented then it must return **YES** for any rows that you want to be able to move.



Implementations of this functionality as a subclass (like [Ben Vogelzang](https://github.com/bvogelzang), [Florian Mielke](https://github.com/FlorianMielke) and [Daniel Shusta](https://github.com/shusta) did) prevent it from being used on UITableViews that are already built into other classes.

## Example usage:

````
#import "UITableView+Reorder.h"
self.tableView.allowsLongPressToReorder = YES;
````

That is all it takes to enable it. There is also `self.tableView.allowsLongPressToReorderDuringEditing` in case you want to enable reordering while in edit mode without using the reordering handles provided by iOS.

Or a real example with the details and in context....

````
@implementation myTableViewControllerSubclass

- (void) viewDidLoad {
    self.tableView.allowsLongPressToReorder = YES;
}

- (NSInteger) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView numberOfRowsInSection: (NSInteger) section {
    NSInteger rowCount = [self.tableData[section] count];
    // -=-=-=- **The row below is added for this category to work** -=-=-=-
    rowCount = [tableView adjustedValueForReorderingOfRowCount: rowCount forSection: section];
    return rowCount;
}

- (UITableViewCell *) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath {
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";
    // -=-=-=- **The row below is added for this category to work** -=-=-=-
    indexPath = [tableView dataSourceIndexPathFromVisibleIndexPath: indexPath];
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier: CellIdentifier];
    
    // Configure the cell...
    // -=-=-=- **The row below is added for this category to look nice** -=-=-=-
    if( [tableView shouldSubstitutePlaceHolderForCellBeingMovedAtIndexPath: indexPath] ) {
        cell.hidden = YES;
    } else {
        cell.textLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Data element %@", self.tableData[indexPath.section][indexPath.row]];
    }
    return cell;
}
````

## Details

This category creates a long press gesture recognizer and attaches it to the tableView object when the `allowsLongPressToReorder` property is set true (and/or the `allowsLongPressToReorderDuringEditing` property is set true for the same effects while editing).
This gesture recognizer makes sure that when a row is long-pressed the
tableView allows row reordering and the specific row is moveable. If so it
creates a temporary view that will track the user's finger up and down the
screen, asks the tableView to reload that cell (so you can provide a place
holder cell, typically blank or hidden), records the starting location, 
and destination locations and shuffles the cells on the screen as it goes.
When the user lifts his or her finger then the standard `- (void) tableView: (UITableView *) tableView moveRowAtIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) fromIndexPath toIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) toIndexPath` method on the table view's `datasource` is called
so the data source can be adjusted to match the current screen configuration.

Any of the UITableViewDelegate or UITableVewDataSource methods that could be called while a row is being dragged up or down the screen needs to be modified because there is a separation between what is on the screen and what is in the data source. To do this there is an instance method added to the UITableView class that will convert the row index visible on the screen to the row index in the datasource. This method is:

````
- (NSIndexPath *) dataSourceIndexPathFromVisibleIndexPath: (NSIndexPath *) indexPath;
````

Any method that is passed an `NSIndexPath` that will be used to access the underlying data model for the table view should be adjusted using this method (specific examples are `tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:` and `tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:`).

When the transient destination section is different from the source section the number of rows in these sections will be different on the screen compared to what is in the datasource. That is, the destination section will have one more row and the source section will have one less row.
To automatically adjust for this the `tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:` should have the value that it would have returned modified with:

````
- (NSInteger) adjustedValueForReorderingOfRowCount: (NSInteger) rowCount forSection: (NSInteger) section;
````


### Gesture Recognizer Properties

If you want to change the `CFTimeInterval
UILongPressGestureRecognizer.minimumPressDuration` just set
`self.tableView.longPressToReorderMinimumPressDuration = 0.5;`.
Reminder: default is `0.5`.
